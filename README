Zimbra Mass Account Management System
=====================================

This script was written to allow easy management of multiple accounts based on
user lists written as text files. It was written primarily with the intent of
being run from the crontab in order to enable/disable user accounts on certain
times in order to enforce company policies.


Usage
-----

The script works by reading email addresses from .list files on its configuration
directory (/etc/4linux by default). It then takes the requested action on the
accounts. Its syntax is the following

zmbaccmgt [enable|disable]
